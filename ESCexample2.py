# Here is an example of how you could control two electronic speed controllers (ESCs) 
# using a Raspberry Pi in python:

# This code sets the specified GPIO pins as output pins, creates two PWM instances, 
# and starts them with a duty cycle of 0 to stop the motors. It then sets the duty cycle 
# to control the speed of the motors, waits for 10 seconds, and stops the motors by 
# setting the duty cycle to 0. Finally, it cleans up the GPIO pins.

# Note that this is just an example implementation and a more sophisticated approach 
# would be needed for a real-world application. For example, you may want to include 
# more advanced control logic or handle exceptions to ensure the program runs safely 
# and reliably.

# Import the necessary libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Set the GPIO mode to BOARD, which refers to the pin numbers on the physical board
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)

# Set the GPIO pins that will be used to control the ESCs
pin1 = 12
pin2 = 16

# Set the GPIO pins as output pins
GPIO.setup(pin1, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(pin2, GPIO.OUT)

# Create two PWM instances, one for each ESC
esc1 = GPIO.PWM(pin1, 50)
esc2 = GPIO.PWM(pin2, 50)

# Start the PWM instances with a duty cycle of 0, which should stop the motors
esc1.start(0)
esc2.start(0)

try:
  # Set the duty cycle of the PWM instances to control the speed of the motors
  esc1.ChangeDutyCycle(50)
  esc2.ChangeDutyCycle(50)
  
  # Keep the program running for 10 seconds
  time.sleep(10)
  
  # Stop the motors by setting the duty cycle to 0
  esc1.ChangeDutyCycle(0)
  esc2.ChangeDutyCycle(0)
  
finally:
  # Clean up the GPIO pins
  esc1.stop()
  esc2.stop()
  GPIO.cleanup()
